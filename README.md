# DotA Bots

## Description
This source code uses [Valve's API](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Dota_Bot_Scripting)
in order to have functional, harder and challenging DotA bots.

## Installing
There are two ways to use these bots:
- Subscribe to this workshop package.
- Download the latest release of this repository and put the `bots` directory (it is important you don't change the name of this directory) on
`game/dota/scripts/vscripts/`.

## Running
Always leave the console open to check if things are running as they should.
Make a custom lobby on the local host and check the `Fill empty slots with bots` option.
Then, choose a bot's difficulty that is different from `None`.
You can now choose on the dropdown menu of `Radiant/Dire bots` the local dev script option to activate your bots.

## Developing
Clone this repository and put it on `game/dota/scripts/vscripts/`.
